/**
 * Evidence-Based Engineering Skill - Demonstration
 *
 * This file demonstrates how to use the Evidence-Based Engineering skill
 * to validate code quality, test coverage, and completeness.

export {};
/**
 * Key Principles Demonstrated:
 *
 * 1. Implementation ≠ Complete
 *    - Code can be implemented but not tested
 *    - Tested but not validated
 *    - Validated but not documented
 *
 * 2. Binary Test Coverage
 *    - Each function either has tests or doesn't
 *    - No percentage claims without measurement
 *
 * 3. Evidence-Based Assessment
 *    - Measured: Actual test coverage from test file analysis
 *    - Estimated: Approximations clearly labeled
 *    - Assumed: Assumptions explicitly stated
 *    - Unknown: Gaps acknowledged
 *
 * 4. Risk Identification
 *    - Missing error handling
 *    - Incomplete tests
 *    - TODOs and FIXMEs
 *    - Documentation gaps
 *
 * 5. Actionable Recommendations
 *    - Specific fixes, not vague suggestions
 *    - Prioritized by risk severity
