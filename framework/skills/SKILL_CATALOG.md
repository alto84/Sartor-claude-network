## Core Skills (Always Available)

### 1. evidence-based-validation
**Location**: `/home/alton/.claude/skills/evidence-based-validation/`
**Priority**: CRITICAL

Enforces anti-fabrication protocols and prevents unsupported claims.

**Use when**:
- Making quantitative claims
- Analyzing performance
- Reviewing code quality
- Assessing systems

**Key rules**:
- Never fabricate scores
- All claims need evidence
- Distinguish measured vs estimated
- Use conservative percentages

### 2. evidence-based-engineering
**Location**: `/home/alton/.claude/skills/evidence-based-engineering/`
**Priority**: CRITICAL

Prevents fabricated metrics in engineering work.

**Use when**:
- Reporting test results
- Claiming completion percentages
- Making delivery rate claims
- Assessing readiness

**Key rules**:
- Evidence before claims
- Measurement before metrics
- Honesty about unknowns

## Swarm-Specific Skills

### 8. memory (Framework)
**Location**: `/home/alton/claude-swarm/framework/memory/MEMORY_SKILL.md`

Swarm memory system access.

**Use for**:
- Storing findings for future agents
- Querying past agent knowledge
- Inter-agent coordination messages
- Session state management

### 9. validation (Framework)
**Location**: `/home/alton/claude-swarm/framework/skills/VALIDATION_SKILL.md`

Output validation using the anti-fabrication framework.

**Use for**:
- Validating agent outputs before submission
- Checking reports for superlatives
- Ensuring scores have evidence
- Pre-output quality gates

**Key features**:
- 5 validation rules (superlatives, scores, uncertainty, evidence, citation-format)
- Programmatic API: `validate()`, `validateAndSuggest()`
- 24-test validation suite (100% pass rate)
- 6-test integration suite (100% pass rate)
- CLI tool for quick checks

## How to Use Skills

### From Within an Agent

1. **Reference the skill path** in your analysis:
   ```
   Reading /home/alton/.claude/skills/evidence-based-validation/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Follow skill protocols** for the relevant domain

3. **Store learnings** in semantic memory for future agents:
   ```bash
   echo '{"topic":"patterns","content":"Learned: X"}' >> .swarm/memory/semantic/patterns.jsonl
   ```

### Skill Priority

1. **Always apply**: evidence-based-validation, evidence-based-engineering
2. **Apply when relevant**: multi-agent, mcp, debugging skills
3. **Apply for research**: safety-research-workflow

## Adding New Skills

1. Create directory in `/home/alton/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with activation triggers and protocols
3. Add `README.md` with overview
4. Update this catalog
