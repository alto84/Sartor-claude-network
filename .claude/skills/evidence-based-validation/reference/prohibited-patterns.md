# Prohibited Language Patterns Reference

This document provides a comprehensive list of prohibited language patterns extracted from the anti-fabrication protocols.

## CRITICAL Level - Never Use These

### Impossible Perfection

**Patterns:**

- "perfect", "perfectly", "perfection"
- "flawless", "flawlessly"
- "error-free", "zero-error"
- "100%", "100.0%"
- "infallible"
- "bulletproof"
- "foolproof"
- "fail-safe"
- "guaranteed" (when claiming certainty)
- "never fail", "cannot fail", "impossible to fail"

**Why Prohibited:**
These terms claim absolute perfection, which is statistically impossible and cannot be verified without exhaustive testing.

**Examples of Violations:**

- "The implementation is perfect with flawless error handling."
- "This approach is bulletproof and cannot fail."
- "The system achieves 100% accuracy with zero errors."

**Compliant Alternatives:**

- "The implementation includes error handling for observed cases. Edge cases may exist."

- "unmatched"
- "unbeatable"
- "unsurpassed"
- "unrivaled"
- "incomparable"
- "supreme"
- "ultimate"
- "definitive"

**Why Prohibited:**
These terms describe mathematical impossibilities or make claims that require precise measurement to verify.

**Examples of Violations:**

**Why Prohibited:**
These patterns make sweeping comparative claims without providing baseline measurements or controlled comparisons.

**Examples of Violations:**

- "Our approach exceeds every industry benchmark."
- "This solution is superior to all current options and leads the market."

**Compliant Alternatives:**

- "Comparison to alternatives requires controlled benchmarking. Not performed."

## MEDIUM Level - Use with Caution

### Superlative Abuse

**Patterns:**

## LOW Level - Generic Marketing Language

### Marketing Speak

**Patterns:**

- "innovative"
- "modern"
- "robust"
- "scalable"
- "flexible"
- "versatile"
- "comprehensive"
- "complete"
- "full-featured"
- "all-in-one"
- "reliable"
- "stable"
- "consistent"
- "dependable"

**Why Discouraged:**
These terms are vague and overused in marketing. They add little informational value.

**Preferred Alternative:**
Describe specific characteristics instead:

- Instead of "robust": "Includes error handling for [specific scenarios]"
- Instead of "scalable": "Supports configuration for multiple instances. Load testing not performed."
- Instead of "comprehensive": "Implements [list specific features]"

| -------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| CRITICAL | "Cannot determine without measurement" | "Perfect", "Flawless", "Best in class"             |

## Pattern Detection Rules

The validation script detects these patterns using case-insensitive regex matching:

**CRITICAL patterns** trigger immediate validation failure
**HIGH patterns** require substantial evidence to justify
**MEDIUM patterns** should be replaced with specific descriptions
**LOW patterns** are acceptable but discouraged

---

## When Uncertain

If you're unsure whether a term is prohibited:

1. **Ask**: "Can I measure or verify this claim?"
2. **Consider**: "Am I describing what I observe, or judging quality?"
3. **Replace**: Use factual observation instead of quality judgment
4. **Test**: Run the validation script to check

**Rule of thumb**: If it sounds impressive, it probably needs evidence.
