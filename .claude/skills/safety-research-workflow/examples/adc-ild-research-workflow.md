## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**1. Multi-Agent Specialization:**

- Dividing search by domain (clinical, mechanistic, regulatory) increased coverage
- Specialized agents brought unique perspectives
- Parallel execution saved time

**2. Quality Gates:**

- Early validation caught 3 critical issues before synthesis
- Prevented downstream errors
- Automated checks saved manual review time

**3. CLAUDE.md Integration:**

- Anti-fabrication rules prevented placeholder sources
- Banned language checks improved scientific rigor
- Limitations requirement ensured balanced presentation

**4. Automated Validation:**

- `validate-bibliography.py` caught all format and authenticity issues
- `research-quality-check.py` verified compliance
- Saved hours of manual checking

### Challenges Overcome

**Challenge 1: Source Inaccessibility**

- Some URLs became inaccessible
- Solution: Used DOI links (more stable) or found alternative sources

**Challenge 2: Conflicting Data**

- Different studies reported different ILD rates for same ADC
- Solution: Reported ranges, discussed heterogeneity, cited all sources

**Challenge 3: Incomplete Citations**

- Some regulatory documents lacked traditional citation elements
- Solution: Used regulatory-specific format with access dates and URLs

### Process Improvements for Future Research

1. **Start validation earlier:** Run automated checks after each agent completes, not at end
2. **Use DOI preferentially:** More stable than journal URLs
3. **Document as you go:** Easier to track methodology during research than reconstruct after
4. **Cross-validation:** Having independent validator improved data accuracy
5. **Quality gate enforcement:** Strict quality gates prevented proceeding with flawed data
