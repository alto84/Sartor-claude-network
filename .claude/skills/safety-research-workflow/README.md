# Safety Research Workflow Skill

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Created:** 2025-10-18
**Updated:** 2025-12-11 (Memory MCP Integration)
**Skill Type:** Advanced Research Methodology

## Overview

The Safety Research Workflow skill provides comprehensive guidance for conducting rigorous, evidence-based safety research with multi-agent coordination, systematic literature review, citation management, and quality assurance. This is the capstone skill that integrates all four foundational skills to enable publication-grade research outputs.

**NEW in v2.0:** Memory MCP integration enables persistent learning across research sessions. Research findings are stored as semantic memories, successful methodologies as procedural memories, and complete project histories as episodic memories. This allows continuous improvement and knowledge accumulation over time.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Conduct systematic literature reviews
- Perform pharmaceutical or medical safety assessments
- Coordinate multiple research agents with specialized roles
- Manage bibliographies and citations for research reports
- Validate research claims and evidence chains
- Ensure research quality through automated checks
- Synthesize findings from multiple sources with proper attribution

## Quick Start

1. **Read SKILL.md** for complete methodology and workflows
2. **Use templates** to plan your research project
3. **Run validation scripts** to check bibliography and compliance
4. **Follow workflows** for systematic execution
5. **Review examples** to see real research in action

## Validation Scripts

### validate-bibliography.py

**Purpose:** Detect fabricated sources and format issues

**Usage:**

```bash
python scripts/validate-bibliography.py bibliography.md [--check-access] [--strict]
```

**Checks:**

- PMID format and authenticity (detects fake PMIDs)
- DOI format and validity
- URL accessibility and placeholder detection
- Title/author placeholder patterns
- Citation completeness

**Example Output:**

```
=== Bibliography Validation Report ===

Total Citations: 165
PMIDs: 146/165 (88.5%)
DOIs: 165/165 (100%)

CRITICAL ISSUES: 0
WARNINGS: 0

OVERALL STATUS: PASS
```

### research-quality-check.py

**Purpose:** Validate research quality and CLAUDE.md compliance

**Usage:**

```bash
python scripts/research-quality-check.py manuscript.md [--check-all]
```

**Checks:**

- Unsupported claims (assertions without citations)
- CLAUDE.md violations (score fabrication, banned language)
- Confidence level justifications
- Limitations section presence

**Example Output:**

```
=== Research Quality Check Report ===

CLAUDE.MD COMPLIANCE:
✓ Score fabrication: 0 violations
✓ Banned language: 0 violations
✓ Unsupported claims: 0

OVERALL QUALITY: EXCELLENT
Status: PASS
```

## Common Research Pitfalls (Avoided)

**Fabrication:**

- Creating fake PMIDs → Detected by validate-bibliography.py
- Using placeholder sources → Detected by pattern matching
- Fabricating consensus scores → Prevented by CLAUDE.md checks

**Methodology:**

- Inconsistent inclusion criteria → Prevented by documented protocol
- Cherry-picking results → Prevented by comprehensive search
- Inadequate limitations → Required by quality gates

**Citation:**

- Incomplete bibliographic info → Detected by completeness checks
- Inaccessible URLs → Detected by accessibility checks
- Missing source identifiers → Flagged as critical issue

## Getting Started

### For Systematic Literature Review:

1. **Use research-plan-template.md** to plan your project
2. **Define PICO question** for focused search
3. **Assign specialized agents** (search, extract, validate, synthesize, QA)
4. **Execute systematic search** with documented strategy
5. **Validate bibliography** using validate-bibliography.py
6. **Extract evidence** with citations for every claim
7. **Synthesize findings** with appropriate confidence
8. **Check compliance** using research-quality-check.py
9. **Final QA** before delivery

### For Safety Assessment:

1. **Review examples/adc-ild-research-workflow.md** for real example
2. **Follow multi-agent workflow** from workflows/
3. **Apply quality gates** between each stage
4. **Use validation scripts** continuously, not just at end
5. **Integrate all 5 skills** for comprehensive quality

## Best Practices

1. **Validate early and often** - Run scripts after each stage, not just at end
2. **Document as you go** - Easier than reconstructing later
3. **Use quality gates strictly** - Don't proceed if validation fails
4. **Preserve disagreements** - Don't fabricate consensus
5. **Be skeptical** - Default to "needs more evidence" not "probably true"
6. **Acknowledge limitations** - Comprehensive limitations section required
7. **Cite everything** - Every claim needs source attribution

## Success Metrics

Research using this skill should achieve:

- ✓ 0 fabricated sources
- ✓ 100% claim-source mapping
- ✓ 0 CLAUDE.md violations
- ✓ Comprehensive limitations documented
- ✓ Methodology fully reproducible
- ✓ Publication-ready quality

  type: "semantic",
  importance: 0.9,
  tags: ["adc", "ild", "incidence", "research-finding"]
})
```

**Store a successful methodology:**

```
memory_create({
  content: "Search strategy: PubMed 'ADC AND toxicity' 2015-2024, yielded 165 relevant from 847 total",
  type: "procedural",
  importance: 0.8,
  tags: ["literature-search", "adc", "success-pattern"]
})
```

**Retrieve past research:**

```
memory_search({
  type: "episodic",

  limit: 10
})
```
