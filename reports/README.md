# Analysis Reports

This directory contains analysis reports generated by the Sartor-Claude-Network agent system.

## Main Reports

### poetiq_pattern_analysis.md

**Date:** 2025-12-10
**Analyst:** AUDITOR Agent
**Subject:** Analysis of poetiq-arc-agi-solver repository for Phase 6 multi-expert patterns

Comprehensive analysis extracting patterns from the poetiq-arc-agi-solver GitHub repository, including:

- Repository structure overview
- 7 key patterns analyzed (parallel execution, voting, diversity, scoring, sandboxing, rate limiting, feedback)
- Mapping to Sartor architecture
- Recommended adaptations and patterns to avoid
- Risk assessment and implementation priorities

**Key Finding:** Poetiq's architecture is simpler than expected. Sartor's existing multi-expert system is already more sophisticated in most areas.

## Agent Introspection Reports

Located in `agents/` subdirectory.

### auditor_poetiq_review_20251210_214931.md

AUDITOR agent's introspection on the Poetiq pattern analysis, including:

- Confidence assessment by pattern
- Potential biases identified
- What couldn't be verified
- Self-critique and lessons learned
- Compliance with anti-fabrication protocols

## How to Read These Reports

1. **Start with main report** (poetiq_pattern_analysis.md) for findings
2. **Check introspection** (agents/auditor\_\*.md) to understand confidence levels and limitations
3. **Review evidence chain** - All claims cite specific files or code snippets
4. **Note uncertainty** - Reports use confidence levels and explicitly state what couldn't be verified

## Evidence Standards

All reports follow CLAUDE.md anti-fabrication protocols:

- No score fabrication
- Evidence chain for all claims
- Uncertainty explicitly expressed
- Limitations disclosed
- Skepticism enforced
