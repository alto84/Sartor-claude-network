  "output": "## Task Complete\n\nI've analyzed the validation framework test suite and written my findings to `.swarm/results/validation-test-gen4.md`.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Test Suite Structure**: 18 test cases across 5 categories testing anti-fabrication validation rules\n\n2. **17/18 Acceptability Assessment**: \n   - **Conditionally acceptable** - depends on which test fails\n   - **Not acceptable** if any superlative (error-level) test fails (SUP-001 to SUP-004)\n   - **Possibly acceptable** if a warning-level test fails (SCR/UNC/EVI tests)\n   - Investigation needed to identify the specific failing test\n\n3. **Validation Logic**:\n   - Superlatives trigger `error` severity (blocks validation)\n   - Scores, uncertainty, and evidence rules trigger `warning` severity (doesn't block)\n   - `passed = (errors === 0)` regardless of warnings\n\n**Recommendation**: Run the actual test suite to identify which specific test is failing before determining if 17/18 is acceptable. The nature of the failing test is critical to this determination.\n",
