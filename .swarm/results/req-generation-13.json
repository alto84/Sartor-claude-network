  "output": "I see. The swarm system shows a fully operational state from a previous mission that ran overnight (Dec 15, 2025). The mission appears to have been successful with:\n\n- 10 checkpoints completed\n- All frameworks operational (memory, skills, validation, bootstrap)\n- All tests passing (24/24 validation tests, 6/6 integration tests)\n- Research complete (arxiv, Anthropic, GitHub research)\n\nThere are **no pending requests** in the `.swarm/requests/` directory, which explains why my task objective says \"No objective specified.\"\n\n**Status Summary:**\n\nAs mission-coordinator, I'm ready to coordinate work but no specific task has been assigned. The swarm infrastructure is in a healthy, fully-operational state from previous work.\n\n**Available Actions:**\n\n1. **Await new task** - The user can provide a specific objective for me to coordinate\n2. **Review previous work** - I can analyze the checkpoints and artifacts from the overnight mission\n3. **Run validation** - I can verify the current state of the frameworks\n\nWould you like to:\n- Assign a new mission objective?\n- Review the results of the previous overnight mission?\n- Something else?\n",
