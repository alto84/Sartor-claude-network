  "output": "**Generation 19 Complete - Hypothesis 2 (Lazy Context Loading) Implementation**\n\nCreated `/home/alton/claude-swarm/coordinator/local-only-lazy.js` with the following features:\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Minimal startup prompt with essential info only (objective + first N requirements)\n- Full context saved to `.swarm/context/{requestId}.json` for on-demand loading\n- Context file pointers in prompt for agents to load if needed\n- Small context (under 500 chars) inlined, large context deferred\n- Startup latency tracking (time to first output)\n- Context efficiency metrics (bytes loaded vs available)\n- Memory topic integration via bootstrap.sh\n- Parent result file pointers for context chain\n\n**Configuration Options:**\n- `CONTEXT_MODE=lazy|full` - Control context injection strategy\n- `MAX_INLINE_CONTEXT_CHARS=500` - Threshold for inline vs deferred context\n- `MAX_ESSENTIAL_REQUIREMENTS=3` - Number of requirements to include inline\n- `ENABLE_CONTEXT_FILES=true|false` - Control context file creation\n- `LOG_PROGRESS=true` - Detailed logging\n\n**Expected Improvement:** 30-50% startup time reduction, prevents instruction truncation from oversized context.\n\n**Spawned Generation 20** to create `coordinator/local-only-optimized.js` combining all 4 hypotheses for maximum efficiency gains.\n",
