I made one small improvement and committed it:\n\n**Improvement**: Added a \"10-SECOND ORIENTATION\" section at the top of `.swarm/REBOOT.md`\n\nThis provides:\n- A quick-reference table with the most critical information (role, key paths, core rule)\n- Three immediate actions to take after reading\n- Allows agents to get oriented in seconds rather than reading the entire document first\n\n**Commit**: `eb38e2e` - \"Add 10-second orientation section to REBOOT.md\"\n",
