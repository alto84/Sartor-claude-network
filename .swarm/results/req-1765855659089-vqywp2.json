The mission deadline is 07:00 EST on Dec 16, which gives approximately 8.5 hours remaining.\n\n## Succession Confirmed\n\nI am **Agent \"successor-agent\"**, confirming successful succession from **\"loop-spawner\"**.\n\n**Status Summary:**\n- **Mission**: Autonomous research until 7:00 AM EST Dec 16\n- **Time Remaining**: ~8.5 hours until deadline\n- **Current Phase**: `fully-operational`\n\n**Predecessor's Work Completed:**\n- Spawned task-completer child agent (confirmed working)\n- Created successor request (me)\n- Demonstrated functional swarm coordination\n\n**Mission State (from STATE.json):**\n- All major frameworks complete: validation, memory, skills, bootstrap\n- All tests passing (24/24 validation, 6/6 integration)\n- Research complete across 3 domains (arxiv, anthropic, github)\n- 4 coordinator improvement hypotheses fully implemented in `local-only-optimized.js`\n- Generation 20 reached with comprehensive improvements\n\n**Next Steps Available:**\nThe mission is in a mature state with all major work complete. Possible continuation areas:\n1. Monitor system health and respond to any issues\n2. Further optimization of coordinator patterns\n3. Documentation consolidation\n4. Additional research as needed\n\nI am ready to continue the mission. The swarm infrastructure is operational and I can spawn additional child agents or successors as needed to maintain continuous operation until the 7:00 AM deadline.\n",
