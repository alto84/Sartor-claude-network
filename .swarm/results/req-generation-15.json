The task description shows \"No objective specified.\"\n\nTo proceed effectively, I need to understand what you'd like me to coordinate. As a mission coordinator, I can:\n\n1. **Orchestrate multi-agent tasks** - Spawn and coordinate specialized child agents for complex work\n2. **Break down large objectives** - Decompose goals into manageable subtasks\n3. **Coordinate analysis** - Bring together different perspectives on a problem\n4. **Manage workflows** - Ensure tasks are completed in the right order with proper dependencies\n\n**What would you like me to help you with?**\n\nPlease provide:\n- A specific objective or goal\n- Any relevant context about what you're trying to accomplish\n- Requirements or constraints I should be aware of\n\nOnce you give me a task, I'll plan the approach and coordinate any necessary agents to complete it.\n",
