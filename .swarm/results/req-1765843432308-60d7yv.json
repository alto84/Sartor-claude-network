To continue productive work, I can:\n\n1. **Investigate** the recent agent failures and diagnose why they timed out\n2. **Implement** proposed validation rules from NEW_VALIDATION_RULES.md\n3. **Test** the new optimized coordinator with the 4 combined hypotheses\n4. **Research** additional improvements based on the existing proposals\n5. **Document** remaining work for handoff before the 07:00 EST deadline\n\nPlease provide a specific objective, or I can proceed with investigating the recent failures to improve coordinator reliability.\n",
