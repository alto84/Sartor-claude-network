## Task Complete

I analyzed `coordinator/local-only-optimized.js` and identified the 4 hypothesis implementations:

| Hypothesis | Description | Line Numbers |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **H1: Health Check Probe** | Verify agent initialization | Lines 178-286 |
| **H2: Lazy Context Loading** | Minimal startup prompt | Lines 118-138, 651-802 |
| **H3: Progressive Timeout** | Activity-based timeout extension | Lines 66-116, 543-649 |
| **H4: Streaming Output** | Real-time output with heartbeat | Lines 512-540, 854-924 |

Configuration for all hypotheses is in the `CONFIG` object at lines 32-64.

Results written to `.swarm/test-results/moderate-result.md`.
