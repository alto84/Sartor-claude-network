==========================================

I notice that I'm configured as a "worker" agent in a multi-agent swarm, but no specific task objective has been specified. The task objective shows "No objective specified."

I'm ready to help, but I need to know what you'd like me to work on. Could you please provide:

1. **A specific task or objective** - What would you like me to accomplish?
2. **Any relevant context** - Files to examine, code to write, bugs to fix, features to implement, etc.

I have access to various tools for:
- Reading and editing files
- Running bash commands
- Searching codebases
- Web searches and fetches
- Spawning child agents for parallel work

What would you like me to do?
