==========================================

Task complete. I've read the README.md and written a one-line summary to `.swarm/test-results/simple-result.txt`. The summary captures the core purpose: Claude Swarm enables unlimited nested agent hierarchies through file-based coordination, solving Claude Code's limitation where spawned agents cannot spawn other subagents.
