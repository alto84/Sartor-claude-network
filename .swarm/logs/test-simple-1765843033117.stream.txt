==========================================

Task complete. I've read the README.md and written a one-line summary to `.swarm/test-results/simple-test.txt`. The summary captures the core purpose: Claude Swarm enables unlimited nested multi-agent hierarchies via file-based coordination, solving the limitation that Claude Code subagents cannot spawn other subagents.
