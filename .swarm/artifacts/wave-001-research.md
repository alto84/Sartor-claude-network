# Wave-001 Research Summary

## Agent: wave-spawner
## Request ID: wave-001
## Status: COMPLETED

## Codebase Analysis

**Claude Swarm** is a multi-agent coordination system that overcomes Claude Code's Task tool limitation (cannot spawn nested subagents) through file-based coordination.

### Key Architecture Components

1. **Coordinator** (`/coordinator/`)
   - Multiple implementations: local-only, streaming, progressive, lazy, health-check
   - Watches `.swarm/requests/` for JSON agent spawn requests
   - Spawns Claude CLI instances via child processes
   - Manages concurrency (default 5 agents)

2. **Framework** (`/framework/`)
   - **Memory System**: Episodic, semantic, working memory with caching
   - **Validation Engine**: Anti-fabrication enforcement with 5 rules
   - **Bootstrap System**: Agent context injection at spawn
   - **Skills Registry**: Dynamic skill loading and assignment

3. **Swarm Runtime** (`/.swarm/`)
   - `requests/` - Pending agent spawn requests
   - `processing/` - Currently executing requests
   - `results/` - Completed agent outputs
   - `artifacts/` - Shared knowledge and research
   - `memory/` - Persistent memory stores

### Coordination Patterns Supported
- Fan-out/Fan-in (parallel research)
- Pipeline (sequential task flow)
- Hierarchical (nested teams)
- Continuous agents (self-perpetuating)
- Event-driven (file watchers)

### Technologies
- Node.js 18+ with ESM modules
- TypeScript for framework components
- Optional Firebase for distributed coordination
- Claude Code CLI for agent spawning

## Successor Wave Spawned

Three specialized researchers created:
1. `coordination-pattern-researcher` - Documenting coordination patterns
2. `memory-system-researcher` - Analyzing memory architecture
3. `validation-framework-researcher` - Studying anti-fabrication validation

## Limitations Observed
- Cannot determine coordinator uptime without process inspection
- Results directory shows prior activity but current state unclear
- No empirical metrics on system performance available
