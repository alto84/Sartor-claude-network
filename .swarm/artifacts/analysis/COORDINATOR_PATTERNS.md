# Coordinator Agent Patterns Analysis

*Generated by ANALYST subagent - 2025-12-15*

## Quick Facts
- **25 total tasks** across 11 generations
- **16 successes (64%)** | **9 failures (36%)**
- **Time span**: ~5 hours (17:20-23:09 EST)

## Critical Findings

### 1. Success/Failure is Binary
- **Successful tasks**: Always produce 100-1,420 characters of output
- **Failed tasks**: Always produce exactly 0 bytes, hit hard timeout
- No "partial success" pattern exists

### 2. Three Timeout Tiers
- **Tier 1 (~120s)**: 3 failures (early Gen 1-2 tests)
- **Tier 2 (~300s)**: 3 failures (experimental variations)
- **Tier 3 (~600s)**: 3 failures (different configuration attempts)

### 3. Root Cause: Early Process Death
Failures caused by:
- Missing tool access (`claude -p` mode limitation)
- Missing permissions flag
- Process crashes before first output

**Evidence**: Zero output in all failures = agents fail immediately, not after partial work.

### 4. Optimal Zone: 50-200 Seconds
- All 16 successful tasks fall within this range
- 100% success rate when agent initializes correctly

## What Works
- Bounded file I/O operations
- Fixed-iteration benchmarking
- Framework implementation
- Sequential generation progression

## What Fails
- Tasks that produce no output in first 120+ seconds
- Operations lacking tool access
- Missing working directory context

## Recommendations
1. **Set timeout to 240 seconds** (all successes + 30% margin)
2. **Require minimum 100 character output** (all failures = 0 bytes)
3. **Verify tool access** before spawning (already fixed)
4. **Add output checkpoints** to detect hanging early

## Key Insight
**Once a coordinator task succeeds in initialization, it completes reliably even with complex work.**
