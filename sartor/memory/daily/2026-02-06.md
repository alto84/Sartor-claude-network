# Daily Log - 2026-02-06
> Session log for February 6, 2026

## Summary
Major setup day for the [[SELF|Sartor]] memory system. Created the full markdown-first
memory structure, completed background research across multiple domains, and
built creative lab pages for the dashboard.

## Completed
- Created Sartor memory system (markdown-first, OpenClaw-inspired architecture)
- Wrote 11 core memory files: [[SELF]], [[ALTON]], [[FAMILY]], [[MACHINES]], [[PROJECTS]], [[BUSINESS]], [[ASTRAZENECA]], [[TAXES]], [[PROCEDURES]], [[LEARNINGS]], and this daily log
- Completed background research on:
  - OpenClaw architecture and patterns (gateway, local-first memory, heartbeat, compaction)
  - [[ASTRAZENECA|AstraZeneca]] AI/ML tools (MILTON, JARVIS) and pharmacovigilance frameworks
  - [[TAXES|Tax preparation]] for 2025 filing year (new deductions under One Big Beautiful Bill Act)
  - SolarInference status and potential directions (see [[BUSINESS]])
- Created Creative Lab dashboard pages:
  - Fractal gallery
  - Mandelbulb 3D GPU renderer
  - Audio visualizer
- Dashboard running on gpuserver1:5000 (Flask app) -- see [[MACHINES]]
- Set up sartor/ directory structure on gpuserver1

## Decisions Made
- Memory format: Markdown files with standard header template
- Storage location: ~/Sartor-claude-network/sartor/memory/ on gpuserver1
- Sync method: Git (push from Rocinante only) -- see [[PROCEDURES]]
- Pattern: OpenClaw-inspired (curated core + daily append-only logs)

## Insights
- Markdown-first approach aligns well with git workflows and Claude Code context loading
- OpenClaw patterns provide a proven foundation without over-engineering
- Having a clear [[MACHINES|machine inventory]] prevents confusion about where things run
- Separating daily logs from core files keeps core knowledge clean and stable

## Next Steps
- Sync memory files to GitHub via Rocinante
- Test memory loading in Claude Code sessions
- Build task harness for semi-autonomous operation
- Add BM25 search over memory files
- Populate [[FAMILY]] when information is available
