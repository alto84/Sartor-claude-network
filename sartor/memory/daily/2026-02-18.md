# Daily Log — 2026-02-18 (Overnight Autonomous Session)

## Summary
Alton gave Claude Code autonomy to improve the safety-research-system overnight. Two conversation sessions (context continuations) produced major feature additions, all deployed live to gpuserver1:8000.

## What Was Built

### Session 1 (earlier context window)
- **P0 Security Hardening**: CORS allowlist, error sanitization, bounded memory stores
- **SapBERT AE Classifier**: GPU-accelerated adverse event classification using `cambridgeltl/SapBERT-from-PubMedBERT-fulltext` on RTX 5090. 430MB VRAM, 0.82s model load, 11/12 correct classifications on real test data. 67 tests.
- **Secondary Malignancy Detection**: FDA boxed warning tracker with 10 curated signals across 6 CAR-T products (Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus, Breyanzi, Abecma, Carvykti). Monitoring protocols per product.
- **Interactive Knowledge Graph**: Force-directed SVG visualization with 112 nodes, 97 edges, pathway filters, node type filters, search, drag interaction.
- **Research reports**: Publication-quality analysis outputs in analysis/ directory

### Session 2 (this context window)
- **Temporal Signal Evolution**: Complete FAERS disproportionality metric tracking (PRR, ROR, EBGM, IC025) over quarterly reporting periods for 6 products × 4 AE categories = 24 temporal profiles. 13 FDA regulatory milestones with overlay. 108 comprehensive tests including metric realism validation.
- **Signal Timeline Dashboard Tab**: Interactive time-series chart with product toggles, AE/metric dropdowns, regulatory milestone timeline, signal summary tables by product and by AE category.
- **Batch Prediction Parallelization**: Replaced sequential for-loop with asyncio.gather for concurrent patient risk scoring.
- **Comparative Safety Heatmap** (in progress): Products × AE categories color-coded by PRR signal strength.

## Stats
- **Tests**: 2133 → 2241 (108 new temporal signal tests)
- **Dashboard tabs**: 25 → 26 (Signal Timeline)
- **API endpoints**: Added 3 new signal endpoints (temporal-evolution, product profiles, regulatory timeline)
- **New files**: temporal_signal.py (1028 lines), test_temporal_signal.py (998 lines)
- **Total commit**: 2716 insertions across 6 files

## Deployment
- Committed: `bfa1617` on master
- Pushed to GitHub: alto84/safety-research-system
- Deployed: gpuserver1:8000 (all endpoints verified live)
- Cross-platform: 2241 tests pass on both Rocinante (38.9s) and gpuserver1 (21.0s)

## Claude.ai Brainstorming
- **Opus 4.6**: Sent innovation prompt, still stuck in extended thinking after hours (never completed)
- **Sonnet 4.6**: Completed with 3 suggestions. Built #1 (temporal signal evolution). #2 (patient-level triage) and #3 (aggregate narrative reports) available as future work.

## What's Next
- Complete comparative safety heatmap (agent running)
- Consider patient-level triage scoring (Sonnet suggestion #2)
- Remaining audit items: P1-1 through P1-8, P2-1 through P2-9 (minus P2-3 done)
- SapBERT: explore fine-tuning on cell therapy AE corpus
