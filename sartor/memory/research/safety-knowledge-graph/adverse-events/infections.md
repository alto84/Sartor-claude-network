## 1. Definition and Scope

Infections following CAR-T cell therapy represent a significant and predictable complication arising from the convergence of three immunosuppressive mechanisms:

1. **Lymphodepleting conditioning:** Fludarabine-cyclophosphamide causes profound lymphopenia and neutropenia
2. **B-cell aplasia:** CAR-T cell-mediated elimination of CD19+ B cells results in loss of humoral immunity
3. **Hypogammaglobulinemia:** Secondary to B-cell aplasia, with IgG nadir typically at 3-6 months post-infusion

The primary risk window spans from **conditioning through B-cell reconstitution**, with the highest-risk period during the first 30 days (neutropenic phase) and an extended moderate-risk period during B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia.

## 2. Risk Windows and Timeline

### 2.1 Phase 1: Neutropenic Period (Day 0 to Day 14-28)

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| Primary risk | Bacterial infections (Gram-negative > Gram-positive), invasive fungal infections |
| Duration | Until neutrophil engraftment (ANC > 500/uL) |
| Typical organisms | *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*, coagulase-negative staphylococci, *Candida* spp. |
| Risk level | HIGH |

### 2.2 Phase 2: B-Cell Aplasia (Day 14 to Day 86-112)

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| Primary risk | Viral reactivations (HSV, VZV, CMV, HBV), encapsulated bacteria |
| Mean duration of B-cell aplasia in SLE CAR-T | 86-112 days (Erlangen, Sichuan cohorts) |
| Key vulnerability | Loss of antibody-mediated immunity while T-cell reconstitution occurs |
| Risk level | MODERATE |

### 2.3 Phase 3: Hypogammaglobulinemia (Day 28 to 6-12+ months)

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| Primary risk | Sinopulmonary infections, encapsulated bacteria (*S. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*) |
| Duration | Until IgG normalization (may persist 6-12+ months) |
| IgG nadir timing | Typically 3-6 months post-infusion |
| Risk level | LOW-MODERATE (with IVIG support) |

## 3. Incidence

### 3.1 In Autoimmune CAR-T (SLE Focus)

| Infection Type | Incidence | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Any infection | ~15% | Mostly Grade 1-2 | Pooled Erlangen + Sichuan data, n=47 |
| Pneumonia (bacterial) | ~5-8% | Grade 2-3 | Most common serious infection reported |
| Viral reactivation (HSV/VZV) | ~5% | Grade 1-2 | With acyclovir prophylaxis |
| Invasive fungal infection | 0% (0/47) | N/A | None reported; prophylaxis used |
| Febrile neutropenia | ~10% | Grade 3 | Often overlaps with CRS window |
| Opportunistic infection (PJP, CMV) | 0% (0/47) | N/A | None reported; prophylaxis used |
| Infection-related mortality | 0% (0/47) | N/A | No infection deaths in autoimmune CAR-T to date |

**Key autoimmune-specific observations:**
- Infection rates are substantially LOWER than oncology, reflecting younger patients, fewer prior immunosuppressive lines, and better baseline immune reserve
- Most infections are uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections or mild pneumonia
- No cases of invasive fungal infection, PJP, or CMV disease reported (with prophylaxis)
- IgG levels often recover within 6-9 months as B-cell reconstitution occurs

### 3.2 In Oncology CAR-T

| Infection Type | Incidence | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Any infection (Day 0-28) | 20-30% | Grade 2-4 | Meta-analysis of DLBCL trials |
| Any infection (Day 28-365) | 25-40% | Grade 2-4 | Predominantly viral and sinopulmonary |
| Serious infection (Grade 3+) | 20-30% | Grade 3-4 | Bacteremia, pneumonia, invasive fungal |
| Invasive fungal infection | 5-10% | Grade 3-4 | *Aspergillus*, *Candida* spp. |
| Viral reactivation (CMV, HBV) | 10-15% | Variable | Higher with prior transplant |
| PJP | 2-5% | Grade 3-4 | Without prophylaxis |
| Infection-related mortality | 2-5% | Fatal | Primarily in refractory/relapsed patients |

## 4. IgG Monitoring and IVIG Replacement

### 4.1 Monitoring Protocol

| Time Period | Frequency | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-infusion (baseline) | Once | Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) |
| Day 28 | Once | IgG level |
| Month 2-6 | Monthly | IgG level |
| Month 6-12 | Every 2 months | IgG level |
| Month 12+ | Every 3 months | IgG level (until stable and >500 mg/dL for 6 months) |

### 4.2 IVIG Replacement Criteria

| IgG Level | Action |
|---|---|
| IgG < 400 mg/dL | **Initiate IVIG replacement** (0.4 g/kg every 4 weeks) |
| IgG 400-500 mg/dL | Consider IVIG if recurrent infections |
| IgG 400-500 mg/dL, no infections | Monitor closely; IVIG optional |
| IgG > 500 mg/dL | Continue monitoring; no IVIG needed |

**IVIG dosing:**
- Standard dose: 0.4 g/kg IV every 4 weeks
- Trough-targeted dosing: Adjust to maintain IgG trough > 500 mg/dL
- SubQ immunoglobulin (SCIG) is an alternative for outpatient convenience
- Duration: Continue until IgG sustained > 500 mg/dL off IVIG for >= 3 months

### 4.3 Autoimmune-Specific Considerations
- In SLE patients, baseline IgG may be elevated (hypergammaglobulinemia from autoimmune B-cell hyperactivity)
- Post-CAR-T IgG decline is expected and may be therapeutic (reducing pathologic autoantibody production)
- Decision to replace should balance infection risk against potential re-emergence of autoreactive B cells
- Most autoimmune CAR-T patients achieve B-cell reconstitution and IgG normalization within 6-9 months

## 5. Infection Prophylaxis Recommendations

### 5.1 Standard Prophylaxis Regimen

| Agent | Target | Dose | Duration | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acyclovir or Valacyclovir | HSV/VZV reactivation | Acyclovir 400 mg BID or Valacyclovir 500 mg BID | Until B-cell reconstitution AND IgG normalization | Strong (standard of care) |
| Fluconazole | Fungal prophylaxis (Candida) | 200-400 mg daily | During neutropenia (ANC < 500/uL for >7 days) | Moderate |
| TMP-SMX (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole) | PJP prophylaxis | 1 DS tablet 3x/week or 1 SS tablet daily | Until CD4 > 200/uL AND off immunosuppression | Strong |
| Levofloxacin (optional) | Bacterial prophylaxis during neutropenia | 500 mg daily | During severe neutropenia (ANC < 100/uL) | Center-dependent; weigh against resistance risk |

### 5.2 Additional Prophylaxis Considerations

| Scenario | Agent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HBV surface antigen positive | Entecavir or tenofovir | Continue for >= 12 months post-B-cell reconstitution |
| HBV core antibody positive (resolved) | Monitor HBV DNA monthly; preemptive antiviral if reactivation | Risk of reactivation during B-cell aplasia |
| CMV seropositive | Monitor CMV PCR weekly x 8 weeks if symptomatic | Preemptive therapy with valganciclovir if >1,000 copies/mL |
| History of tuberculosis | Evaluate for latent TB pre-infusion; treat if indicated | Isoniazid or rifampin regimen |
| Prior invasive fungal infection | Extended antifungal prophylaxis (posaconazole or voriconazole) | Duration individualized |

### 5.3 Prophylaxis Duration Summary

All prophylaxis should continue until BOTH conditions are met:
1. **B-cell reconstitution** (detectable CD19+ B cells in peripheral blood, typically by flow cytometry)
2. **IgG normalization** (IgG > 500 mg/dL without IVIG support)

In practice for SLE CAR-T patients, this typically means 4-9 months of prophylaxis.

## 6. Vaccination

### 6.1 During B-Cell Aplasia (NO Live Vaccines)

**Absolutely contraindicated during B-cell aplasia:**
- Live attenuated vaccines: MMR, Varicella, Zoster (Zostavax), Yellow Fever, Oral Polio, BCG, Intranasal Influenza (FluMist)
- Replication-competent viral vector vaccines

**May be administered (but efficacy is uncertain without B cells):**
- Inactivated influenza (injection)
- COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (may prime T-cell response even without B cells)
- Other inactivated vaccines (limited utility without humoral response)

### 6.2 Post-B-Cell Reconstitution Revaccination Schedule

| Vaccine | Timing Post-B-Cell Recovery | Doses | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pneumococcal (PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23) | 3-6 months post-reconstitution | Per standard schedule | Priority: encapsulated bacteria risk |
| Influenza (inactivated) | Seasonally, as soon as B cells detectable | Annual | May have suboptimal response initially |
| COVID-19 (mRNA) | 3 months post-reconstitution | Per current CDC recommendations | Check antibody response |
| Tdap | 6 months post-reconstitution | 1 dose, then per schedule | Standard recommendation |
| Hepatitis B | 6 months post-reconstitution | 3-dose series if anti-HBs lost | Check titers first |
| Varicella/Zoster (Shingrix, recombinant) | 6 months post-reconstitution | 2 doses | Shingrix is NOT live; safe |
| MMR | 12+ months post-reconstitution | Consider if serology negative | LIVE vaccine; only when fully immunocompetent |

### 6.3 Autoimmune-Specific Vaccination Considerations
- Revaccination may theoretically risk re-triggering autoimmune responses by stimulating newly reconstituted B cells
- No evidence to date that post-CAR-T vaccination triggers SLE flare, but this is an active area of monitoring
- In SLE patients, pre-CAR-T vaccination history may be incomplete due to immunosuppression; treat as if vaccine-naive

## 7. Special Populations and Considerations

### 7.1 Patients on Prior Rituximab
- Rituximab-experienced patients may have pre-existing hypogammaglobulinemia
- Baseline IgG should be documented; IVIG may need to start earlier
- B-cell aplasia duration may be shorter (residual anti-CD20 effect waning)

### 7.2 Concurrent Immunosuppression
- All background immunosuppression is typically discontinued before or during lymphodepletion
- Corticosteroids for CRS/ICANS treatment temporarily worsen infection risk
- Patients requiring re-initiation of immunosuppression (rare in autoimmune CAR-T responders) need intensified prophylaxis
