# Local Immune Effector Cell-Associated Toxicity Syndrome (LICATS)

## Definition

Local Immune effector Cell-Associated Toxicity Syndrome (LICATS) is a **novel toxicity entity first described in 2025**, unique to autoimmune CAR-T therapy. It refers to local immune reactions occurring at sites of prior autoimmune disease involvement, interpreted as CAR-T cells actively "cleansing" residual immune infiltrates in previously affected tissues.

LICATS is **not observed in oncology CAR-T** and represents a fundamentally different type of immune effector cell toxicity from [[adverse-events/CRS]], [[adverse-events/ICANS]], and [[adverse-events/ICAHS]].

## Incidence and Demographics

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Patient population** | 39 patients with autoimmune diseases | SLE (n=15), inflammatory myopathy (n=12), systemic sclerosis (n=12) |
| **Overall LICATS incidence** | **77%** (30/39 patients) | |
| **Total LICATS reactions** | 54 reactions in 30 patients | Average 1.8 reactions per affected patient |
| **Patients with multiple reactions** | ~50% of affected patients | Sequential or concurrent involvement of multiple organ systems |

## Temporal Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Median onset** | Day 10 post-infusion (range: day 3-45) |
| **Median duration** | 11 days (range: 2-60+ days) |
| **Relationship to CRS** | Occurs AFTER CRS resolves (distinct temporal window) |
| **Relationship to B-cell aplasia** | Occurs ONLY during B-cell aplasia phase |
| **Relationship to prior disease** | Occurs ONLY in previously affected organs |

## Manifestations by Organ System

| Organ System | Frequency | Manifestations | Typical Severity |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Skin** | **35%** of reactions | Flare of prior lupus rash, scleroderma skin changes, dermatomyositis rash; erythema, edema at previously affected sites | Mostly Grade 1-2 |
| **Kidneys** | **22%** of reactions | Transient proteinuria increase, hematuria, mild creatinine rise in patients with prior lupus nephritis | Mostly Grade 1-2; some Grade 2-3 |
| **Musculoskeletal** | **19%** of reactions | Joint swelling/pain at previously arthritic joints, myositis flare (CK elevation) in prior myositis sites | Mostly Grade 1 |
| **Other** | ~24% of reactions | Serositis (prior pericarditis/pleuritis sites), interstitial lung disease flare (SSc), oral ulcers | Variable |

## Severity Distribution

| Grade | Frequency | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Grade 1** | **65%** | Mild, self-limited reactions requiring no intervention or minimal symptomatic treatment |
| **Grade 2** | **30%** | Moderate reactions requiring outpatient medical intervention (short-course steroids, analgesics) |
| **Grade 3** | **~5%** (3 patients) | Required hospitalization; no ICU admissions |
| **Grade 4-5** | **0%** | No life-threatening or fatal LICATS events |

**Key safety message:** Despite high incidence (77%), LICATS is overwhelmingly mild. Only 3/39 patients (7.7%) required hospitalization, and no patient required ICU care.

## Pathophysiology (Proposed Mechanism)

```
CAR-T cell infusion and expansion
       |
       v
CAR-T cells traffic to tissues with residual immune infiltrates
(lymph nodes, skin, kidneys, joints, serosal surfaces)
       |
       v
Local engagement with CD19+ B cells / plasmablasts
in autoimmune tissue infiltrates
       |
       v
Local immune activation
  - Focal cytokine release (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma)
  - Local macrophage activation
  - Complement activation at tissue level
       |
       v
Tissue-specific inflammatory response
  - Edema, erythema (skin)
  - Proteinuria, hematuria (kidney)
  - Synovitis (joints)
  - Serositis (serosal surfaces)
       |
       v
Resolution as target cells are eliminated
  - Self-limited (median 11 days)
  - Correlates with local B-cell depletion
  - Resolves during ongoing B-cell aplasia
```

### Key Mechanistic Features

1. **Organ tropism mirrors prior disease:** LICATS ONLY affects organs that were previously involved by autoimmune disease. A patient with lupus nephritis but no skin involvement will have renal LICATS but not cutaneous LICATS.

2. **Temporal restriction to B-cell aplasia:** All LICATS events occur during the B-cell aplasia window, supporting the model that CAR-T cells are actively engaging residual tissue-resident B cells.

3. **Self-limited course:** The finite duration (median 11 days) is consistent with elimination of a limited pool of tissue-resident target cells, after which the local immune reaction resolves.

4. **Distinct from disease flare:** LICATS is distinguished from autoimmune disease flare by:
   - Occurring in the context of B-cell aplasia (flares require B-cell reconstitution)
   - Self-limited without immunosuppressive treatment escalation
   - Not associated with rising autoantibody titers (autoantibodies decline during this period)
   - Correlated with CAR-T expansion kinetics

## Clinical Significance

### Positive Interpretation
LICATS may be a **biomarker of efficacy**: the local immune reactions likely reflect CAR-T cells successfully reaching and destroying pathogenic B-cell infiltrates in target organs. Patients with LICATS may have more thorough tissue-level B-cell depletion.

### Management Implications
- **Expectant management** is appropriate for Grade 1-2 LICATS
- Short-course low-dose corticosteroids for symptomatic relief if needed
- Renal LICATS: monitor creatinine and proteinuria closely; typically self-resolves
- **Do NOT interpret LICATS as treatment failure or disease flare**
- Do NOT escalate immunosuppression for LICATS (it is self-limited and may indicate efficacy)

### Patient Counseling
- Patients should be informed pre-infusion that temporary worsening of symptoms in previously affected organs is expected and likely indicates the treatment is working
- Onset typically ~10 days post-infusion, lasting ~11 days
- Seek medical attention for severe symptoms but most cases resolve spontaneously

## Relationship to Other Adverse Events

| Comparison | CRS | ICANS | ICAHS | LICATS |
|-----------|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Systemic cytokine storm | BBB disruption + neuroinflammation | Macrophage activation | Local tissue-level B-cell targeting |
| **Distribution** | Systemic | CNS-specific | Systemic (hematologic/hepatic) | Organ-specific (prior disease sites) |
| **Timing** | Day 0-7 | Day 4-10 | Day 7-21 | **Day 10 (median)** |
| **Seen in oncology?** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **NO - autoimmune only** |
| **Requires treatment?** | Often | Yes (Grade 2+) | Always | Rarely |
| **Prognostic significance** | Adverse | Adverse | Adverse | **Possibly favorable** |

## Unanswered Questions

1. **Dose-response:** Does higher CAR-T dose increase LICATS frequency or severity?
2. **Predictive factors:** Can baseline disease activity or imaging predict LICATS location/severity?
3. **Efficacy correlation:** Is LICATS severity correlated with depth or durability of response?
4. **BCMA-directed CAR-T:** Will LICATS occur with non-CD19 targets in autoimmune disease?
5. **Formal grading system:** No ASTCT consensus grading exists for LICATS yet (grading used in Hagen et al. was ad hoc)
6. **Long-term tissue effects:** Does LICATS cause any lasting tissue damage, or is it entirely self-limited?
