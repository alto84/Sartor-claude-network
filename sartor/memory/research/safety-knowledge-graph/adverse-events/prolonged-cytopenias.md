# Prolonged Cytopenias in CAR-T Therapy

> **Status:** Active | **Last Updated:** 2026-02-07
> **Category:** Adverse Event -- Hematologic Toxicity
> **ICD-10:** D70.9 (Neutropenia, unspecified), D69.59 (Thrombocytopenia, unspecified)
> **CTCAE Version:** 5.0

## 1. Definition

**Prolonged cytopenias** are defined as Grade 3 or higher cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or anemia) persisting beyond **Day 28** post-CAR-T cell infusion that are not attributable to disease progression or other identifiable causes.

The key cytopenia subtypes:
- **Neutropenia:** ANC < 1,000/uL (Grade 3) or < 500/uL (Grade 4)
- **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelets < 50,000/uL (Grade 3) or < 25,000/uL (Grade 4)
- **Anemia:** Hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4)

### Distinction from ICAHT
The EHA/EBMT consensus introduced the term **ICAHT (Immune Effector Cell-Associated Hematotoxicity)** as a broader framework that includes prolonged cytopenias alongside other hematologic manifestations. Prolonged cytopenias are the most common clinical presentation within the ICAHT spectrum.

## 2. ICAHT Grading (EHA/EBMT Consensus, 2023)

| Grade | Neutropenia Criteria | Duration | Management Implications |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grade 1 | ANC >= 1,000/uL by Day 28 | Resolved by Day 28 | Standard monitoring |
| Grade 2 | ANC >= 500/uL by Day 28, but < 1,000/uL | Partial recovery by Day 28 | Increased monitoring, consider G-CSF |
| Grade 3 | ANC < 500/uL at Day 28, recovered by Day 60 | Persistent 28-60 days | G-CSF mandatory, infection prophylaxis |
| Grade 4 | ANC < 500/uL beyond Day 60 | Persistent >60 days | Intensive support, bone marrow evaluation |

## 3. Incidence

### 3.1 In Autoimmune CAR-T (SLE Focus)

| Cytopenia | Incidence | Grade | Median Recovery | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Neutropenia (any) | ~100% | Grade 3-4 | Day 10-14 with G-CSF | Mackensen et al. 2022, Erlangen |
| Neutropenia (prolonged, >Day 28) | ~15-20% | Grade 3-4 | Day 35-50 | Erlangen expanded cohort |
| Late neutropenia (new onset) | 13% (4/30) | Grade 3 | Median onset Day 71 (range 43-120) | Erlangen expanded cohort |
| Thrombocytopenia | ~40% | Grade 2-3 | Day 14-21 | Pooled autoimmune data |
| Anemia | ~30% | Grade 2-3 | Variable | Pooled autoimmune data |

**Key autoimmune-specific observations:**
- Neutropenia is universal but predominantly **reversible** with G-CSF support
- Late-onset neutropenia (beyond Day 28, new occurrence) is a distinct phenomenon observed in the Erlangen expanded cohort: 4/30 patients, median onset Day 71, all responsive to G-CSF
- The severity and duration of cytopenias in autoimmune patients is **substantially milder** than in oncology, attributed to younger age, better baseline bone marrow reserve, and absence of prior intensive chemotherapy
- No cytopenia-related deaths reported in any autoimmune CAR-T cohort

### 3.2 In Oncology CAR-T

| Setting | Prolonged Cytopenia (>Day 28) | Grade 3-4 | Median Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| DLBCL (axi-cel, ZUMA-1) | 30-40% | 25-35% | Day 60-90 |
| DLBCL (tisa-cel, JULIET) | 30-35% | 20-30% | Day 45-90 |
| DLBCL (liso-cel, TRANSCEND) | 25-30% | 20-25% | Day 30-60 |
| Multiple Myeloma (cilta-cel) | 50-60% | 40-50% | Day 60-120+ |
| Multiple Myeloma (ide-cel) | 40-50% | 30-40% | Day 60-90 |

**Oncology-specific factors contributing to higher rates:**
- Extensive prior chemotherapy (median 3-4 prior lines) damaging hematopoietic stem cell reserve
- Active bone marrow infiltration by malignancy
- More intensive lymphodepleting conditioning
- Higher CRS severity driving secondary hematotoxicity (cytokine-mediated bone marrow suppression)

---

## 4. Pathophysiology

### 4.1 Mechanisms of Post-CAR-T Cytopenias

1. **Direct lymphodepletion effect:** Fludarabine-cyclophosphamide conditioning ablates lymphocytes and suppresses myelopoiesis. This is the primary driver of early (Day 0-14) cytopenias.

2. **CRS-mediated bone marrow suppression:** Inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-1) during CRS directly suppress hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Higher CRS grades correlate with more severe and prolonged cytopenias.

3. **Stromal niche disruption:** CAR-T cell-mediated inflammation can damage the bone marrow stromal microenvironment, impairing hematopoietic support. This is hypothesized as the mechanism for late-onset cytopenias.

4. **Immune dysregulation:** B-cell aplasia and T-cell reconstitution dynamics may indirectly affect hematopoietic regulation through altered cytokine milieu.

### 4.2 Biphasic Pattern
A characteristic **biphasic pattern** has been described:
- **Early phase (Day 0-14):** Direct conditioning effect, predictable, recovers with G-CSF
- **Late phase (Day 28+):** Multifactorial (CRS-mediated, stromal, immune dysregulation), less predictable, may require prolonged support

## 5. Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Association | Strength of Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Prior treatment burden (number of prior lines) | Higher treatment burden --> more severe/prolonged cytopenias | Strong (oncology data) |
| Baseline bone marrow reserve (pre-infusion ANC, platelets) | Low baseline --> prolonged recovery | Moderate |
| Lymphodepletion intensity | More intensive conditioning --> deeper nadir and slower recovery | Moderate |
| CRS severity (Grade 2+) | Higher CRS grade --> more prolonged cytopenias | Strong |
| Age | Older age --> slower hematopoietic recovery | Moderate |
| Baseline inflammatory burden | Higher CRP/ferritin --> more CRS-mediated BM suppression | Low-Moderate |
| CAR-T cell dose | Higher dose --> more inflammation --> more BM suppression | Low (confounded) |

**In SLE specifically:**
- Most patients are younger (median age 30-40) with relatively preserved BM reserve
- Fewer prior treatment lines than oncology patients
- Lower CRS burden (Grade 1-2 predominant) limits cytokine-mediated BM suppression
- These factors collectively explain the milder cytopenia profile in autoimmune CAR-T

## 6. Monitoring Protocol

### 6.1 Laboratory Monitoring Schedule

| Time Period | Frequency | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| Day 0-14 (acute phase) | Daily (inpatient) | CBC with differential, reticulocyte count |
| Day 14-28 (early recovery) | 2x per week | CBC with differential |
| Day 28-60 (late recovery) | 2x per week | CBC with differential, reticulocyte count |
| Day 60-90 | Weekly | CBC with differential |
| Day 90-180 | Every 2 weeks | CBC with differential |
| Day 180+ | Monthly | CBC with differential |

### 6.2 Bone Marrow Evaluation Triggers
- Grade 4 neutropenia persisting beyond Day 60
- New-onset cytopenias after initial recovery (to rule out MDS/secondary malignancy)
- Unexplained multi-lineage cytopenias not responsive to G-CSF

## 7. Management

### 7.1 G-CSF (Filgrastim/Pegfilgrastim)

| Indication | Dose | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| ANC < 500/uL at Day 14 | Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/day SC | Until ANC > 1,000/uL for 2 consecutive days |
| Recurrent or late-onset neutropenia | Filgrastim 5-10 mcg/kg/day SC | Until ANC recovery; consider pegfilgrastim if recurrent |
| Febrile neutropenia | Filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day SC + broad-spectrum antibiotics | Until afebrile and ANC > 500/uL |

**Caution:** Some centers delay G-CSF until Day 14+ to avoid theoretical risk of enhancing CAR-T cell expansion. No definitive evidence that G-CSF impairs CAR-T efficacy; emerging data suggests it is safe.

### 7.2 Transfusion Support
- **Platelets:** Transfuse for platelets < 10,000/uL (prophylactic) or < 50,000/uL with active bleeding
- **Red blood cells:** Transfuse for Hgb < 7.0 g/dL (or < 8.0 g/dL if symptomatic or cardiovascular comorbidity)
- **Irradiated blood products** recommended during immunosuppressed period to prevent TA-GVHD

### 7.3 Infection Prophylaxis During Cytopenic Period
- Acyclovir/valacyclovir for HSV/VZV reactivation
- Fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis when ANC < 500/uL for >7 days
- TMP-SMX for PJP prophylaxis (start after engraftment to avoid marrow suppression)
- Low threshold for empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics if febrile

### 7.4 Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists (Emerging)
- Eltrombopag or romiplostim may be considered for refractory thrombocytopenia (>60 days)
- Limited evidence in post-CAR-T setting; case reports only
- Risk-benefit should be discussed given potential for thrombotic complications

---

## 8. Prognosis

- In autoimmune CAR-T: **Excellent.** All reported cytopenias have been reversible. No cytopenia-related mortality. Late neutropenia (Day 71 median onset) responds to G-CSF within 7-14 days.
- In oncology CAR-T: Generally good for most patients, but 5-10% may have very prolonged (>6 month) cytopenias requiring ongoing support. Rare cases of aplastic anemia or MDS reported.
