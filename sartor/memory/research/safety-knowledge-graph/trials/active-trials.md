# Active Phase I-II CAR-T Trials in SLE

## Overview

As of early 2025, there are approximately 45 active or planned Phase I-II clinical trials investigating CAR-T cell therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and related autoimmune diseases globally. This registry captures the most prominent trials with publicly available information, organized by sponsor and target.

The field is rapidly evolving; new trial registrations appear monthly, particularly from China where >60% of registered autoimmune CAR-T trials originate.

| **Sponsor** | Miltenyi Biotec (in partnership with Erlangen University Hospital) |
| **Target** | CD19 |
| **CAR design** | 4-1BB costimulatory domain; point-of-care manufacturing |
| **NCT Numbers** | NCT06106048 (Phase 1/2 SLE), NCT06221254 (Phase 1/2 expanded autoimmune) |
| **Phase** | Phase 1/2 |
| **Indications** | SLE, systemic sclerosis, inflammatory myopathy, ANCA-associated vasculitis |

**Safety relevance:** This program is the direct extension of the Mackensen et al. 2022 published cohort ([[adverse-events/CRS]] baseline data). The CASTLE data will be the largest prospective safety dataset for autoimmune CAR-T.

### 2. RESET-SLE (Cabaletta Bio / Rese-cel)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | Rese-cel (CABA-201 / desmoteplase) |
| **Sponsor** | Cabaletta Bio |

| **NCT Number** | NCT06121297 |
| **Phase** | Phase 1/2 |
| **Indication** | SLE |
| **Enrollment** | ~50-80 planned |
| **Dose** | Dose escalation cohorts (starting ~1 x 10^6/kg) |

| **Sites** | Multi-center US |
| **Status** | Active, enrolling |
| **Expected completion** | 2027 |
| **Key feature** | First US-based multi-center trial in SLE; fully human CAR reduces anti-CAR immune response |

### 3. KYV-101 (Kyverna Therapeutics)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | KYV-101 |
| **Sponsor** | Kyverna Therapeutics |
| **Target** | CD19 |
| **CAR design** | 4-1BB; fully human; dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor (armored CAR) |

| **Indication** | Lupus nephritis (Class III/IV/V), SLE, systemic sclerosis, myasthenia gravis |
| **Enrollment** | ~60 planned (lupus nephritis cohort) |
| **Dose** | ~1 x 10^6/kg |
| **Sites** | Multi-center US, Europe |
| **Status** | Active, enrolling |
| **Expected completion** | 2027-2028 |
| **Key feature** | "Armored" CAR with dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor designed to resist immunosuppressive microenvironment. Published KYSA-1 trial in lupus nephritis showed deep responses. |

**Safety relevance:** The TGF-beta resistance mechanism could theoretically increase CAR-T activation and thus CRS risk compared to standard constructs. Important safety signal to monitor.

### 4. Breakfree-1 (BMS NEX-T)

| **Phase** | Phase 1 |
| **Indication** | SLE and other autoimmune diseases |
| **Status** | Active, early enrollment |
| **Expected completion** | 2027 |
| **Key feature** | BMS's entry into autoimmune CAR-T; leveraging their oncology CAR-T manufacturing expertise (tisa-cel, liso-cel heritage) |

### 5. Chinese Academic Programs (Multiple)

#### 5a. BCMA-CD19 Compound CAR-T (cCAR)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | BCMA-CD19 cCAR (compound CAR targeting both antigens) |
| **Sponsor** | Various Chinese academic centers |
| **Target** | CD19 + BCMA (dual targeting) |
| **Phase** | Phase 1 |
| **Indication** | Refractory SLE |
| **Enrollment** | Multiple small cohorts (5-15 patients each) |
| **Key feature** | Dual targeting aims to eliminate both CD19+ B cells AND BCMA+ plasma cells; deeper depletion of antibody-producing cells |

**Safety relevance:** BCMA targeting may increase [[adverse-events/ICAHS]] risk based on oncology BCMA experience. Monitor closely.

#### 5b. CD19 + BCMA Sequential Co-infusion

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | Separate CD19 and BCMA CAR-T products administered sequentially |
| **Sponsor** | Zhejiang University / multiple Chinese centers |
| **Target** | CD19 (first) then BCMA (second) |
| **Phase** | Phase 1 |
| **Indication** | Refractory SLE, lupus nephritis |
| **Key feature** | Sequential infusion allows dose optimization of each target; may reduce combined toxicity vs simultaneous dual-targeting |

#### 5c. Multiple Single-Target CD19 Trials

Numerous Chinese academic centers are conducting investigator-initiated CD19 CAR-T trials in SLE:
- Beijing Shijitan Hospital
- Tongji Hospital (Wuhan)
- Peking University People's Hospital
- Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai)
- Chinese PLA General Hospital
- Estimated 15-20 additional registered trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and ChiCTR

### 6. GC012F / AZD0120 (AstraZeneca / Gracell)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | GC012F (now AZD0120 under AstraZeneca) |
| **Sponsor** | AstraZeneca (acquired from Gracell Biotechnologies) |
| **Target** | CD19 + BCMA (dual-targeting, single construct) |
| **Phase** | Phase 1 |
| **Indication** | SLE (among multiple autoimmune indications) |
| **Key feature** | FasTCAR manufacturing platform; dual-targeting in a single CAR construct; AstraZeneca backing provides major pharma scale |

**Safety relevance:** Dual BCMA+CD19 targeting with different construct than Chinese cCAR. AstraZeneca pharmacovigilance infrastructure will enable systematic safety data collection. Cross-reference [[data-sources/README]] for AZ internal data.

## Allogeneic CAR-T

### 7. Allogeneic CD19 (CRISPR-Edited)

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | Off-the-shelf allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T (CRISPR-edited to remove TCR and MHC) |
| **Sponsor** | Multiple (CRISPR Therapeutics / Vertex; others) |
| **Target** | CD19 |
| **Phase** | Phase 1 |
| **Indication** | SLE and autoimmune diseases |
| **Lymphodepletion** | Flu 25 mg/m^2 x3 + Cy 300 mg/m^2 x2 |
| **Key feature** | Off-the-shelf product eliminates manufacturing wait time; enables immediate treatment; CRISPR-edited to reduce GvHD |

**Safety relevance:** Unique toxicities include:
- Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) risk despite gene editing
- Potential for host-versus-graft rejection (shortened persistence)
- Different CRS kinetics (may be attenuated by reduced persistence)
- Modified [[mitigations/lymphodepletion]] required for engraftment

### 8. Other Allogeneic Programs

- **UCART19 (Cellectis):** TCR-disrupted allogeneic CD19 CAR-T; exploring autoimmune indications
- **CB-010 (Caribou Biosciences):** chRDNA-edited allogeneic CD19 CAR-T; PD-1 knockout
- **ALLO-501A (Allogene):** TALEN-edited allogeneic CD19; primarily oncology but exploring autoimmune

## Non-CD19 Targets in Development

### 9. BCMA-Directed (Standalone)

| Trial Type | Status | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Multiple Phase 1 trials (China) | Active | Target long-lived plasma cells producing pathogenic autoantibodies |
| Safety concern | Monitor for ICAHS | BCMA-directed products have highest [[adverse-events/ICAHS]] risk in oncology |

### 10. CD20-Directed CAR-T

- Broader B-cell targeting (CD20 expressed on more mature B cells than CD19)
- Early phase development
- May target B-cell populations missed by CD19 CAR-T

### 11. APRIL-Based CAR-T (TACI/BCMA Dual-Targeting)

- Uses APRIL ligand instead of scFv to target both TACI and BCMA
- May provide broader plasma cell coverage
- Phase 1 in autoimmune under development

## Safety Monitoring Implications

For the [[models/risk-model]], these active trials collectively represent:
- **Expected safety database growth:** From current ~47 SLE patients to potentially 500+ by 2027
- **Diversification of constructs:** Currently data only from 4-1BB/CD19; upcoming data from CD28, fully human, armored, dual-target, and allogeneic constructs
- **Geographic diversification:** Currently European-dominated; US and Chinese data will reveal population differences
- **New toxicity signals possible:** Dual-targeting (BCMA+CD19) and armored CARs may have different toxicity profiles

### Monitoring Priorities

1. **CASTLE and RESET-SLE:** Most important near-term safety data sources (largest, most structured)
2. **GC012F/AZD0120:** First major pharma-sponsored dual-target trial; AZ pharmacovigilance will be comprehensive
3. **KYV-101:** Armored CAR may reveal new toxicity patterns
4. **Allogeneic programs:** Novel GvHD-related safety signals to watch
5. **Chinese academic trials:** Large patient numbers but variable reporting quality; important for real-world signal detection
