> Last updated: 2026-02-06 by Claude

## Key Facts
- SolarInference.com: Startup in early/idea stage
- [[ASTRAZENECA|AstraZeneca]]: Drug safety and pharmacovigilance AI work
- Two distinct business tracks: startup venture + pharma consulting/employment

## SolarInference

**Website:** SolarInference.com (currently placeholder Coming Soon page)

**Possible Directions:**
- Solar panel yield prediction using weather and satellite data
- Energy production forecasting for grid operators
- AI-driven solar installation optimization
- Predictive maintenance for solar farms
- Edge inference on IoT devices at solar sites

**Status:** Pre-revenue, concept stage. Need to validate market fit and define MVP.
For project-level tracking, see [[PROJECTS]].

## AstraZeneca / Pharma Safety

**Focus Areas:**
- Drug safety signal detection using AI/ML
- Pharmacovigilance automation
- Adverse drug reaction (ADR) identification and classification

See [[ASTRAZENECA]] for detailed coverage of AZ tools, frameworks, and regulatory landscape.

**Key Tools and Methods in Pharma Safety:**
- FAERS database (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System)
- Disproportionality analysis methods: PRR, ROR, BCPNN, MGPS
- NLP-based ADR extraction from medical literature and social media
- Machine learning classifiers for case triage and signal prioritization
- Deep learning for unstructured medical text processing

**Regulatory Landscape:**
- Growing acceptance of AI/ML in pharmacovigilance
- Explainability requirements (LIME, SHAP) for regulatory submissions
- EMA and FDA both exploring AI-assisted safety monitoring

## Tax Implications

Both business tracks have tax implications for the 2025 filing year.
See [[TAXES]] for deductions, estimated payments, and filing details.

## Open Questions
- SolarInference: What is the target customer segment?
- SolarInference: Funding strategy (bootstrap vs. seed)?
- AZ work: Full-time or consulting arrangement?
- Any IP considerations between the two tracks?
