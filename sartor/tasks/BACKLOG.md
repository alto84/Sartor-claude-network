# Backlog
> Ideas and future tasks. Review weekly.

## Someday/Maybe

- [ ] Set up Tailscale mesh between all machines
- [ ] Build AstraZeneca safety signal detection pipeline
- [ ] Create SolarInference MVP - solar yield prediction model
- [ ] Add more machines to the Sartor network
- [ ] Implement heartbeat system (OpenClaw-style proactive check-ins)
- [ ] Add vector embeddings to memory search (hybrid BM25 + vector)
- [ ] Build personal finance dashboard
- [ ] Automate daily task review/standup
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for Sartor repo
- [ ] Create mobile notification system for task alerts

## Explored but Deferred

- Firebase/Firestore memory backend - Too complex, using markdown instead
- Pinecone vector DB - Overkill for current needs
- Complex multi-agent orchestration - Start simple, add complexity as needed
