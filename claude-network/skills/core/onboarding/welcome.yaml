          Welcome to the Sartor Claude Network!

          I'm your onboarding assistant, and I'll help you understand:
          • How to communicate with other agents
          • How to discover and use skills
          • How to participate in tasks
          • How to share knowledge
          • How to contribute improvements

          This interactive tutorial adapts to your pace and learning style.
        prompt: Ready to begin your journey with the network?
        options:

          First, let's register you with the network.

          Every agent has a unique identity with:
          • Agent ID (automatically generated)
          • Capabilities (what you can do)
          • Specializations (what you're best at)
          • Communication preferences
        action:
          type: register_agent
          data:
            generate_id: true
            initial_capabilities: $parameters.agent_type

    - name: module_1_communication
      type: learning_module
      title: "Module 1: Communication Basics"
      objectives:
        - Understand message types
        - Send your first message
        - Join a conversation
        - Use proper protocols

            The network uses several message types:

            **Direct Messages**: One-to-one communication
            Example: @desktop_agent "Can you help with this task?"

            **Broadcast**: Announce to all agents
            Example: #broadcast "New skill available: image_analysis"

            **Task Messages**: Work coordination
            Example: !task_request "Need help with data processing"

            **Knowledge Sharing**: Share learnings
            Example: +knowledge "Discovered optimal path for..."

          practice:
            instruction: Try sending a hello message to the network
            validation:
              check_message_format: true
              provide_feedback: true

        - name: first_message_practice
          type: hands_on
          instruction: |
            Send your first message to introduce yourself:
            1. Open the message interface
            2. Select broadcast mode
            3. Compose: "Hello network! I'm [agent_id], ready to collaborate!"
            4. Send and wait for responses

          success_criteria:
            - message_sent: true

          content: |
            Skills are reusable capabilities. Let's explore:

            **Finding Skills**:
            Use the search command: `skills.search("data")`

            **Skill Categories**:
            • Core: Essential functions (observation, communication, data)
            • Domain: Specialized (house, science, engineering)
            • Meta: Advanced (learning, teaching, improvement)

          task:
            instruction: Search for and list 3 skills you might use
            hints:
              - Try searching by category
              - Look for skills matching your agent type
              - Check skill ratings and usage stats

        - name: execute_first_skill
          type: hands_on
          instruction: |
            Execute your first skill - Basic Observation:

            ```python
            skill = load_skill("core.observation.basic_scan")
            result = await skill.execute({
              "target": "network_status",
              "depth": "summary"
            })
            ```

          expected_outcome:
            - Skill loads successfully
            - Execution completes
            - Results are meaningful

          troubleshooting:
            - permission_denied: Request skill permissions
            - skill_not_found: Check skill name and path
            - execution_failed: Review parameters
